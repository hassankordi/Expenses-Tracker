👋 Hello Inovola Team!
I'm Hassan Kordi, and I’m excited to share with you the task I’ve built as part of the interview process.

🧭 Application Overview
Upon launching the application, you’ll be directed to the login dashboard.

You can log in using any dummy credentials.

After login, you’ll be redirected to the main page, where you'll see a default expense entry of $100.

You can see Total expenses in the front of the dashboard and its counting...

You can then add more expenses and see the system in action.

🛠️ Technical Highlights
The app is built using standalone components, signals, custom directives, and pipes to ensure better performance and maintainability.

I utilized RxJS to shape and manage data streams efficiently. Specifically, I used shareReplay to cache responses, as the data is not frequently updated—improving performance and reducing redundant API calls.

All selected currencies are automatically converted to USD for consistent display and calculation.


▶️ Getting Started
To run the application locally:

# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Run the development server
ng serve
Then open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:4200


🔍 Notes
Pagination was intentionally skipped, as I believe it's best handled at the API level for better scalability. However, it’s a straightforward addition on the UI side, and I’d be happy to implement it if required.

Please let me know if you'd like me to walk you through the code or explain specific parts. I’d love the opportunity to contribute to Inovola’s mission and work alongside your talented team.

Warm regards,
Hassan Kordi
